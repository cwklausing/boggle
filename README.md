# React Boggle Board
Wanted to create a simple boggle board generator, came up with this. Uses React and Typescript.

Currently randomizes the boggle dice array, as well as the individual dice, creating a random Boggle board arrangement each time.

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
